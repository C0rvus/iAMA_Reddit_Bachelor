Filename:		thread_lifeSpan_n_commentTime_pieChart.py {year} {calc} {time}
Description: 		This script allows you to calculate two things.
			1. The amount of time how long a thread lasted (Difference between thread creation time stamp and the time stamp of the last comment)
			2. The average mean of comment time.. Means, how long it takes until a comment (regardless whether it is a question or not) has been posted within the thread

Arguments:
	
			{year} 		= 		the year which is to be used for the calculation
					=		2009 || 2010 || 2011 || 2012 || 2013 || 2014 || 2015 || 2016

			{calc}		= 		the data you want to calculate
					=		lifespan || comment
					=		lifespan if you want to calculate the lifespan of a thread, comment is when you want to calculate the average mean comment time within the thread


			{time}		=		the time units in which the calculated values will be seperated into.. (necessary for graph plotting)
					=		min || hours || days
					=		min is for minutes, hours is for separation into hours, days is for seperation into days


Usage example: 		python thread_lifeSpan_n_commentTime_pieChart.py 2009 lifespan days
