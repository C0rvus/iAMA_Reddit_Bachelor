Depending on the Storage Engine you want to use chose the appropriate config file...

WiredTiger is the way to go, but takes up huge amounts of disk space and RAM (~32GB), because it loads all the data into the RAM, even if it is used at the moment or not.

"mmapv1" is way more spare on resources and only loads elemnts into the RAM when necessary. (slower than WiredTiger but more resource friendly).
